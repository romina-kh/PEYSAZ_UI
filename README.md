Welcome to PEYSAZ! To get started, follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your system.

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js 
npm (usually comes with Node.js)

After that, clone the Repository;
The project is divided into two main directories: client and server. You need to install dependencies for both:
1.  cd client
    npm install
2.  cd ../server
    npm install
To run the project, you need to split your terminal into two separate sessions:
1.  cd client
    npm run dev
2.  cd server
    npm run dev
Once both the client and server are running, open your web browser (preferably Google Chrome) and follow the URL.
